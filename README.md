# CS210-project One

This program was made to make a clock that can have the hours, minutes and seconds changed with the user inputs.
In this program I think that my formatting of the code and the functions that I used were used well.
I could improve on my commenting and the efficiency of changes in the clocks time.
The most difficult part of the code to write was getting the seconds to add to the minutes when it reaches 60 and the same for minutes to hours.
The skills with creating functions and using switch statements will be very useful in future projects.
To make this code readable and maintainable I formatted my code well and made it easy to what does what in it.
